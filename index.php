        Hello lucky (or unlucky?) person who has been chosen to exmine my solution :D <br>
        <br>
        Here are a few things to get you started:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First off I made a navigation menu at the top, thatone will follow you.</li>
        <li>Secondly, I oriented the tasks as best as I could and hope you wont have to struggle too much navigating</li>
        <li>Thirdly I have not secured this too much against SQL injection, just Js-editing</li>
        <li>Please enjoy this as much as I did creating it. Although, I probbably made it a mess for you <br><br>:/</li>
    </ul>
